# Release Notes Anchorman v0.9.1

## Summary

This is mostly a clean-up release. There was a glitch with v0.9.0. So ignore that one.

## Breaking Changes

Anchorman is still pre-1.0, so we're in flux.

This release removes the HTML linking of SHAs back to GitHub. The code to support it was annoyingly complex and by using the right code (coming soon) at GitHub for rendering to HTML, there will be even better linking. This was part of the response to #[2](https://github.com/infews/anchorman/pull/2).

## Other Changes, Pull Requests and Bugs

* When generating notes, the description now comes first. This will make it easier to collapse to read and edit the Markdown file as you work through the notes. See [this Tracker story](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/54124569)
* Thanks to #[4](https://github.com/infews/anchorman/pull/4), git repos with more than 30 commits are handled. The current code does not iterate along the commits well yet. So large repos are probably going to break without a lot of memory.
* Fixed a bug that didn't close an underscore in the footer

## Coming Soon

* HTML rendering is up next. Good news - Anchorman will use the GitHub API for rendering Markdown to HTML, giving auto-linking and other awesome formatting. Bad news - you will need an internet connection to release.
